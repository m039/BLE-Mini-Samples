* About

This is my sandbox to play and test BLE Mini

* Project structure

  1. `android-sample` is project [BLE Mini Android Chat sample](https://github.com/RedBearLab/Android/tree/master/Examples/Chat) but with gradle wrapper
  2. `linux-sample` is C program to receive data that `android-sample` sends

  To test `linux-sample` you should install [Biscuit-USBCDC](https://github.com/RedBearLab/BLEMini/blob/master/Firmware/BLE2UART/Biscuit-USBCDC_20140409.bin) firmware to your BLE Mini
